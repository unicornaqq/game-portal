## Key Activities
- Successfully integrated Get Notes MCP service for personal knowledge base queries
- Implemented 300-second timeout for Get Notes API calls to handle complex queries
- Successfully tested Get Notes queries for "短路电流计算" and "无功功率" with detailed technical responses
- Added Get Notes MCP integration to MEMORY.md for future reference
- Configured Discord channel integration with provided bot token
- Analyzed model comparison between Qwen, GLM, and MiniMax for OpenClaw Agent scenarios
- Discussed multi-agent vs subagent architectures and concluded subagents are more suitable
- Implemented intelligent routing strategy using LLM-driven task classification
- Resolved Serper MCP service configuration issues by using direct API calls
- Successfully fetched and summarized AI Edge Twitter post about high-capability reasoning model costs
- Established clear user guidance on configuration safety and autonomous improvement boundaries

## Technical Achievements
- Created Get Notes MCP server with proper error handling and long timeout support
- Successfully queried personal knowledge base with complex technical questions
- Established clear distinction between Serper (public web search) and Get Notes (private knowledge base) usage
- Configured cross-platform support (Feishu + Discord) for consistent user experience
- Optimized search strategies based on query type and information source
- Demonstrated practical application of cost-aware model selection principles

## Decisions Made
- Chose Qwen as primary model due to local deployment (zero cost) and excellent performance
- Selected subagent architecture over multi-agent for simplicity and efficiency
- Implemented LLM-driven intelligent routing instead of keyword-based routing
- Prioritized Get Notes for technical/professional queries and Serper for general/real-time information
- Committed to configuration safety: no unauthorized modifications to system settings
- Established daily imp...
